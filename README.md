This research focused on soybean yield and climate data spanning from 1970 to 2022 for three U.S. states: Illinois, Nebraska, and Minnesota. After gathering the necessary data, I researched soybean planting fundamentals, including soil selection, planting timing, and water management practices. The primary tools used for data processing were online resources and R programming. R enabled comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and the application of advanced statistical techniques. Additionally, R Studio's powerful visualization tools facilitated the creation of charts, graphs, and plots to effectively communicate findings.
